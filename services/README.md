This folder contains a prototype version of Filesystem support library
written in Ada. This is not strictly speaking part of this demo repository
and is meant to be moved to a standalone repository at some point.

The reason of its presence here is to allow filesystem access within some
of the demos (sdcard and wav_reader demos).

The license of this library is GPL+Runtime exception.
